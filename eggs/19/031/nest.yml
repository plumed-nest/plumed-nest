  The input files provided were used in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 245701 (2017)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.245701) to simulate the nucleation of ice from liquid water, using the TIP4P/2005 potential and GROMACS as MD engine. Two reference pdb files are needed, providing the endpoints of the transition. PLUMED must be compiled including the PIV module (configure --enable-modules=piv).
