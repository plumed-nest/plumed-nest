 Input files to carry out MD simulations of the RAD51-BRC4 complex using enhanced sampling methods, namely steered MD and metadynamics. The simulations integrate experimental information, specifically from SAXS in the steered MD and from XL-MS in the metad. The input folders contain all files required to perform the simulations, while the reweighting subfolder in the metad directory includes input files to compute metad weights a posteriori using the final bias. Simulations were conducted using GROMACS 2023.1 patched with PLUMED 2.9. All the files necessary to reproduce the analyses through a Jupyter Notebook are available on Zenodo under accession code 10.5281/zenodo.17035732.
