 Example plumed.dat (glucose_longbox.dat) file to sample COM-distance between two glucose molecules from a standard MD with restraints in x and y direction. Example plumed.dat (A2G2S2_longbox.dat) file to sample COM-distances between two complex N-glycan molecules with restraints in x and y. The distance is additionally biased via a metadynamics potential across multiple replica (RECT), where the glycan molecules are defined as the solute (hot) region (REST2) for enhanced sampling of their conformational phase space. Perform REST-RECT simulations of glycans in solution or bound as substrate to their respective enzyme. GROMACS 2022 was used.
